# MaaXBoard-RT_shell_cm7
 MaaXBoard-RT Shell with command to toggle LEDs (all three)

## converted SDK example
This is an SDK example converted to MaaXBoard-RT.
It provides a shell on Debug UART.
You can set the three LEDs on board on/off.

#Remark
It needs the Debug UART (LPUART1, not 6).
It has a small fix in file "board.h" (LED ON/OFF values flipped).
